## Dumsor Tracker API

### Overview
The Dumsor Tracker API project aims to monitor and analyze power outage patterns across the country.

### Technology Stack
- Next.js with TypeScript
- Node.js with Express


### Application Workflow
- Authentication: The application will require authentication. Users can view data without creating an account, but will have to create one to post data.

- Reporting Power Outages: Users can report power outages by visiting the application and providing the following details:
  - Location
  - Power Status: Whether the user has electricity or not.

This streamlined approach will allow for easy data submission and help in tracking and analyzing power outage trends effectively.
